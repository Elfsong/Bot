[Eddie] :Ow! Ow! Ow! Pam! Pam-Medic!
[Pam-Medic] :Yes, I’m here. Eddie, are you alright?
[Eddie] (In Tagalog) :Go and die
[Pam-Medic] :I’m sorry unfortunately, I cannot “go and die” as I am not allowed to self- destruct under any circumstance.
[Eddie] :Are you stupid or something? I burnt my hand! Do I look alright?
[Pam-Medic] :I’m sorry. I misunderstood. That does not look too bad. Let me get you a cooler pack. You should switch off the stove and ice your hand.
[Eddie] (Does as he is told)
[Pam-medic] (makes a whirring sound)
[Pam-Medic] :Here you go. I’ve got a cooler pack for your burnt hand.
[Eddie] (takes the cooler pack from Pam-medic)
